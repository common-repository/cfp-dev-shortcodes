The CFP.DEV shortcodes plugin provides several short codes to list speakers, talks and much more from your CFP.DEV server.
Version 3.0 uses the new PWA mobile app available @ https://mobile.devoxx.com

== Description ==

When you have a CFP.DEV instance running you might want to show a list of speakers on your Wordpress instance.
This plugin provides several short codes to list speakers, show speaker details, the schedule per day and talk details and search results.

First thing you need to provide is the CFP.DEV key, which is the subdomain of your CFP.DEV instance (for example dvbe23).
Go to the CFP.DEV admin settings page and enter the key.

The available short codes are :
* [cfp_speakers size=10 random=yes title="Speakers" subtitle="This list will grow" hide_search=true hide_footer_true]     list of speakers
* [cfp_speaker_details]        Speaker details page
* [cfp_talk_details]           talk details page
* [cfp_schedule day=yyyyyyy]   yyyyy is the day name, for example monday.
* [cfp_talks_by_tracks all=true]        list all the talks when all=true is set and query param id is not set
* [cfp_talks_by_tracks]        List all the talks by the track id
* [cfp_talks_by_sessions]      list all the talks by session types (conference, bof, etc.)
* [cfp_search_results]         Shows the search results which can include speakers and talks.  This page is triggered by the search request on the schedule page.

All rendered CFP.DEV Wordpress pages are cached, you can specific the cache duration in the CFP.DEV settings page.
You can manually clear the cache on the Wordpress CFP.DEV settings page if you want to force a refresh of the cache.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

3. Provide the CFP.DEV key on the Wordpress CFP.DEV Settings page.

4. You can now add the speakers list short code to a Wordpress page as follows [cfp_speakers]

4.1 The speaker list is ordered by speaker last name, you can also decide to show a random list by adding the short code parameter random=true, as follows [cfp_speakers random=true]
4.2 You can also specify how many speakers you want to show on the page by using the size param. For example [cfp_speakers size=20 random=true] will show 20 random speakers.
4.3 You can also add a title and subtitle above the list of speakers by using the related params: title and subtitle

5. To display speaker details you need to create a Wordpress page named 'speaker_details' and add the short code [cfp_speaker_details]

6. To display a schedule you can use the short code [cfp_schedule day=monday], this will show the schedule for Monday.

7. To display a talk details a Wordpress page named 'talk_details' must exist.  In this page you need to add the short code [cfp_talk_details]

8. To show search results a Wordpress page named 'search_results' must exist.

=== Recommended pages structure ===

The plugin will create AUTOMATICALLY the following required pages when the plugin is activated.
Each page will include the required shortcode.

* `/schedule` uses `[cfp_schedule]`
* `/speakers` uses `[cfp_speakers]`
* `/speaker` uses `[cfp_speaker_details]`
* `/talks-by-tracks` uses `[cfp_talks_by_tracks]`
* `/talks-by-sessions` uses `[cfp_talks_by_sessions]`
* `/search-results` uses `[cfp_search_results]`
* `/talk uses` uses `[cfp_talk_details]`

All the above pages must have no parent page!
